# OpenGL 3D Roaming Gravity Simulation ++

The goal is to simulate Gravity, Bouncing, Intertia and all sorts of natural world like behavior on objects. Materials will eventually be effected based what texture they have. Ex: ice will glide, metal will be heavy, water mechanics later on.

###  Technical Stack
* **Language:** C++ 
* **Graphics API:** OpenGL 4.5+
* **Windowing/Input:** GLFW / GLAD / GLM
* **Tools:** Visual Studio, CMake, 

### Data Analysis
* **Scientific Method Application:** Eventual Exportation of simulation logs to **CSV** and used **Python (Matplotlib)** to visualize performance.
